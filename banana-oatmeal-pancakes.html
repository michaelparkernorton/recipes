        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>1 cup groats</li>
            <li>1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Optional: maple syrup, sliced bananas, berries for topping</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender or food processor, combine the ripe bananas, groats, milk, eggs, baking powder, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Blend the mixture until smooth. If the batter is too thick, you can add a little more milk to thin it out.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with cooking spray or a bit of oil.</li>
            <li>Once the skillet is hot, pour about 1/4 cup of the pancake batter onto the skillet for each pancake.</li>
            <li>Cook the pancakes for 2-3 minutes on one side, or until bubbles form on the surface and the edges start to look set.</li>
            <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the other side, until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the skillet as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your choice of toppings, such as maple syrup, sliced bananas, or berries.</li>
        </ol>
