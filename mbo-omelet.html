		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
				<li>3 eggs</li>
				<li>1/4 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
				<li>1/4 cup diced bell pepper (any color you prefer)</li>
				<li>1/4 cup diced onion</li>
				<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
				<li>1 tablespoon olive oil or butter</li>
				<li>Optional: grated cheese, chopped herbs (like parsley or chives)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions:</h2>
		<ol>
				<li>Heat the olive oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
				<li>Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
				<li>Add the sliced mushrooms and diced bell pepper to the skillet. Cook until they are tender, about 5-6 minutes.</li>
				<li>While the vegetables are cooking, crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork until well mixed. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
				<li>Once the vegetables are tender, spread them out evenly in the skillet.</li>
				<li>Pour the beaten eggs over the vegetables, ensuring they cover the entire surface of the skillet.</li>
				<li>Allow the omelet to cook undisturbed for a few minutes, until the edges start to set.</li>
				<li>Gently lift the edges of the omelet with a spatula and tilt the skillet to let any uncooked egg flow to the edges.</li>
				<li>Once the omelet is mostly set but still slightly runny on top, sprinkle grated cheese over the vegetables if desired.</li>
				<li>Carefully fold one side of the omelet over the other using the spatula, creating a half-moon shape.</li>
				<li>Cook for another minute or until the cheese is melted and the eggs are fully cooked through.</li>
				<li>Slide the omelet onto a plate and garnish with chopped herbs if desired.</li>
				<li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious mushroom, bell pepper, and onion omelet!</li>
