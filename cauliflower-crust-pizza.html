            <li>1 medium head of cauliflower</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or substitute with mozzarella cheese)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (or oregano)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Pizza toppings of your choice (e.g., tomato sauce, cheese, vegetables, meats)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Wash and dry the cauliflower. Cut it into florets, then pulse in a food processor until it resembles rice.</li>
            <li>Microwave the cauliflower rice in a microwave-safe bowl for about 5-6 minutes, or until it's cooked. Let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cooked cauliflower rice to a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth. Squeeze out as much moisture as possible.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the cauliflower rice, egg, Parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Spread the cauliflower mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, shaping it into a thin crust.</li>
            <li>Bake the crust in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until it's golden brown and firm to the touch.</li>
            <li>Once the crust is done, remove it from the oven and add your desired pizza toppings.</li>
            <li>Return the pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the toppings are heated through and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Allow the pizza to cool slightly before slicing and serving. Enjoy your delicious cauliflower rice pizza!</li>
